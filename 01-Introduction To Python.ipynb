    "# What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language.\n",
    "* Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.\n",
    "* Known for its readability and simple syntax which emphasizes code readability and reduces the cost of program maintenance.\n",
    "* Supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming."

    "# Key Features of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Easy to Learn and Use**\n",
    "    - Python has a simple syntax similar to English, which makes it easy to read and write.\n",
    "    - Itâ€™s an excellent language for beginners due to its simplicity and readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interpreted Language**\n",
    "    - Python is an interpreted language, which means that the code is executed line by line.\n",
    "    - This makes debugging easier and is suitable for scripting and rapid application development.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dynamically Typed**\n",
    "    - You don't need to declare the type of a variable when you create one. It is determined at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Portable**\n",
    "    - Python code can run on different platforms without modification (Windows, macOS, Linux).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Extensive Standard Library**\n",
    "    - Python has a large standard library which provides a rich set of modules and functions for various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Community and Support**\n",
    "    - Python has a vast community that contributes to its development and provides a wealth of resources for learning and problem-solving.\n"
