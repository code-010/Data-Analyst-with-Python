    "\">Hypothesis Testing&nbsp;</h2>\n",
    "<p>Hypothesis testing is a tool for making statistical inferences about the population data. Hypothesis testing uses sample data from the population to draw useful conclusions regarding the population probability distribution.</p>\n",
    "<p>It involves formulating two competing hypotheses, the&nbsp;<strong>null hypothesis&nbsp;</strong>(H&nbsp;<sub>0&nbsp;</sub>) and the&nbsp;<strong>alternative hypothesis&nbsp;</strong>(H&nbsp;<sub>a&nbsp;</sub>), and then collecting data to assess the evidence. These two hypotheses will always be mutually exclusive. This means that if the null hypothesis is true then the alternative hypothesis is false and vice versa. For&nbsp;example: testing if a new drug improves patient recovery (H&nbsp;<sub>a&nbsp;</sub>) compared to the standard treatment (H&nbsp;<sub>0&nbsp;</sub>) based on collected patient data.</p>\n",
    "<p><strong>Null Hypothesis</strong></p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>The null hypothesis is a concise mathematical statement that is used to indicate that there is no difference between two possibilities.</li>\n",
    "<li>In other words, there is no difference between certain characteristics of data.</li>\n",
    "<li>This hypothesis assumes that the outcomes of an experiment are based on chance alone. It is denoted as H&nbsp;<sub>0&nbsp;</sub>.</li>\n",
    "<li>Hypothesis testing is used to conclude if the null hypothesis can be rejected or not.</li>\n",
    "<li>Suppose an experiment is conducted to check if girls are shorter than boys at the age of 5. The null hypothesis will say that they are the same height.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis</strong></p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>The alternative hypothesis is an alternative to the null hypothesis.</li>\n",
    "<li>It is used to show that the observations of an experiment are due to some real effect.</li>\n",
    "<li>It indicates that there is a statistical significance between two possible outcomes and can be denoted as H&nbsp;<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>or H&nbsp;<sub>a&nbsp;</sub>.</li>\n",
    "<li>For the above-mentioned example, the alternative hypothesis would be that girls are shorter than boys at the age of 5.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p><strong>How Hypothesis Testing Works?</strong></p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>An analyst performs hypothesis testing on a statistical sample to present evidence of the plausibility of the null hypothesis.</li>\n",
    "<li>Measurements and analyses are conducted on a random sample of the population to test a theory. Analysts use a random population sample to test two hypotheses: the null and alternative hypotheses.</li>\n",
    "<li>The null hypothesis is typically an equality hypothesis between population parameters; for example, a null hypothesis may claim that the population means return equals zero.</li>\n",
    "<li>The alternate hypothesis is essentially the inverse of the null hypothesis (e.g., the population means the return is not equal to zero).</li>\n",
    "<li>As a result, they are mutually exclusive, and only one can be correct. One of the two possibilities, however, will always be correct.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p><strong>Hypothesis Testing P Value</strong></p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>In hypothesis testing, the <strong>p</strong> value is used to indicate whether the results obtained after conducting a test are statistically significant or not.</li>\n",
    "<li>It also indicates the probability of making an error in rejecting or not rejecting the null hypothesis.</li>\n",
    "<li>This value is always a number between 0 and 1.</li>\n",
    "<li>The p value is compared to an alpha level, α or significance level.</li>\n",
    "<li>The alpha level can be defined as the acceptable risk of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis.</li>\n",
    "<li>The alpha level is usually chosen between 1% to 5%.</li>\n",

    "<h3>1. <strong>State the Hypotheses</strong></h3>\n",

    "<li>Set up the<strong> Null Hypothesis (H₀) </strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ).</strong></li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<h3>2. <strong>Choose a Significance Level (&alpha;)</strong></h3>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>The significance level, typically denoted as &alpha;, is the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis. Common choices are 0.05, 0.01, or 0.10. A significance level of 0.05 means that there is a 5% risk of concluding that an effect exists when there is none (Type I error).</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<h3>3. <strong>Select the Appropriate Test</strong></h3>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>The test you choose depends on the type of data and the question being asked. Some common tests include:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><strong>t-test:</strong> Compares the means of two groups.</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>ANOVA:</strong> Compares the means of three or more groups.</li>\n",

    "<h3>4. <strong>Collect and Analyze Data</strong></h3>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
